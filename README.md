<h2> Introduction </h2>
<br>
The project aims at identifying the presence of old age diseases in individuals based on 56 characteristics/features. Further, the project also wants to estimate if there is redundancy in the data so that all 56 characteristics need not be assessed for prediction.

<h2> Dataset & Metrics</h2>
<h3>Dataset</h3>
AB-GL = Fifty-six anonymized health characteristics all numeric.<br>
EJ = categorical variable <br>
Class = Binary target, 1 indicates the subject has been diagnosed with one of the three conditions, 0 indicates they have not.<br>
<h3>Metric</h3>
Since we have
